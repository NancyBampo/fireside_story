    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Anita Baker's "No One In The World" was playing all through the house...</p>
    <p>And we saw ghosts slow dancing everywhere.</p>
    <p>Then suddenly the we heard the record scratch...</p>
    <p>Then "Single Ladies" by Beyonc√© started playing...</p>
    <p>Then the ghost started twerkin' errywhere!</p>
