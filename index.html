    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>Anita Baker's "No One In The World" was playing all through the house...</p>
    <p>And we saw ghosts slow dancing everywhere.</p>
    <p>Then suddenly the we heard the record scratch...</p>
    <p>Then "Push It" by Salt-N-Pepa started playing...</p>
    <p>Then the ghosts started twerkin' errywhere!</p>
    <p>Then we joined in and had a great time!!</p>
    <p>The End!!!</p>
